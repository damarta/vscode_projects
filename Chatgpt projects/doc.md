# 🐍 Python Mentor Chat Summary

This document contains your entire learning journey through Python. It is structured into sections to upload into a custom GPT.

---

## 1. 🧠 Python Basics
- Variables & Data Types (int, float, str, bool, None)
- Local and Global Scope
- Operators (Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, Identity, Membership)
- Conditional Statements (if, elif, else, ternary)
- Loops (for, while)
- Loop Control (break, continue, pass)
- Exception Handling (try, except, else, finally)

---

## 2. 🛠 Functions
- Defining and calling functions
- Parameters and arguments (positional, named)
- Default parameter values
- *args and **kwargs
- Return values
- Function scope and best practices
- Lambda functions
- Functions with lists, conditions, and loops

---

## 3. 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Instances
- Attributes and Methods
- __init__ method
- Encapsulation (private attributes, getters/setters)
- Abstraction (hiding implementation details)
- Inheritance (reusing logic from base class)
- Polymorphism (same method name behaves differently)
- Practical class examples (e.g. Hero, CoffeeMachine)

---

## 4. 🧪 Code Challenges & Debugging
- Exercises on even/odd numbers
- Factorial calculator
- String manipulation (reversal, case, format)
- Loop challenges (triangle patterns, vowel counting)
- Breakpoint feedback and logic correction
- Custom feedback on your own challenges

---

## 5. 📦 Numpy & Arrays
- Creating arrays using `np.array()` and `np.arange()`
- Indexing, reshaping, slicing
- Array methods (`reshape`, `copy`, `sum`, etc.)
- Real-world array examples (e.g. temperatures, matrix ops)
- Practical debugging tips in Jupyter/VSCode

---

## 6. 🎯 Personal Mentor System
- All feedback on your code: clean, corrected, commented
- Visual breakdowns of logic (step-by-step)
- Debugging guidance when things go wrong
- Clear explanations for mistakes and improvements
- Personalized learning pace with increasing challenge

## 📌 Final Notes
This Markdown file is structured so you can paste it into a Custom GPT file, or upload as a knowledge base. You can also copy-paste directly into Notion or VSCode for personal tracking.

Happy coding! 🚀
