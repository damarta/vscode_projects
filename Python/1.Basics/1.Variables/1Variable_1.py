# In Python you need to understand how can you use 'variables' or how you can call them.

# Variables: 
    # 1. Assignment : 
        # - a variables is like a box where we store [ data, words, numbers or even list. ]

    # 2. Naming Conventions:
        # - To writte a clean code you need to follow a couple of rules:
                #1. user letters, numbers and underscores
                #2. Variable name can't start with a number.
                #3. No spaces in names (use _ )
                #4. Avoid special characters ( @, #, % etc...)

    # 3. Scope:
        # - Where can you use your variables?
                # Global
                # Local
