    # 2. Naming Conventions:
        # - To writte a clean code you need to follow a couple of rules:
                #1. user letters, numbers and underscores
                #2. Variable name can't start with a number.
                #3. No spaces in names (use _ )
                #4. Avoid special characters ( @, #, % etc...)

user_name = 'Luis' # Snake_case

User_Name = 'Kai' # PascalCase -> used for class names

user_Name = 'Benthe' # camelCase -> more common in Js or Java

USER_NAME = 'Venus' # UPPERCASE -> used for constants (values that shouldn't change)
