# Variables: 
    # 1. Assignment : 
        # - a variables is like a box where we store [ data, words, numbers or even list. ]


        # ðŸ“Œ Assigning a Value to a Variable:
            # - We use the ' = ' sign to assign a value.

                # name = "Luis" (string)
                # age = 28 (integer)
                # hight = 1.89 (float)
                # Is_woman = False (Boolean)

        # ðŸ“Œ Re-assigning Variable:

            # You can change the value stored in a variable.
            # you only need to re-assigning variable = 'new value'

        # ðŸ“Œ Multiple Assignments:

            # 1. Assign multiple variables in one line:
                #  x, y, z = 1, 2, 3

            # 2. You can also assign the same value to multiple variables:
                # a = b = c = 0
                # print(a, b, c)
